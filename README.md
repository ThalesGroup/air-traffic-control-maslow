# The MasLow Project
The idea of getting everyone talking and building an Air Traffic Control platform from the ground up by and for air traffic controllers (ATCO) could be game changing in aviation industry.

**MasLow** is the foundation on which air-traffic-control.io (https://bit.ly/3Hrc7zs) is built. An Open Source platform intending to build the future of ATC, and this can only happen starting from scratch, jointly with most open-minded and motivated people. 


Special Thx to ATCOs from all over the world: Luis Barbero, Pavol Sitar, Tom Laursen, Anthony Ang, Nadia Bamowongo, Angel Augusto, Anicet Coffie, Jasser Letaief, Timothy Agaba, Kijeon, Navneet Singh Rana, Ivan RadoviÄ‡, Osman Atilla Altintas...
